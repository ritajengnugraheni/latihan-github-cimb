        <h1>6174: Kaprekar's Constant</h1>
<p>Type in any 4 digit number that contains at least 2 different digits (leading zeros are allowed). <strong>Deviating this will cause an infinite loop. You have been warned!</strong>
  <br>
  It will be rearranged into descending and ascending order and the smaller number will be subtracted from the larger one.
  <br>
  The subtracted difference between the 2 numbers will eventually reach 6174 </p>
<input type="text" maxlength="4" />
<button>Go</button>
<p class="counter">It took <span id="counterSpan"></span> iterations to reach Kaprekar's constant.</p>
